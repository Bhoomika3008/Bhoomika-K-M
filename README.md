# Problem Solutions (Python)

This repository contains solutions to 4 problems, written in **Python**.  
Each problem is in a separate file:

- `Problem-1.py` → Calculator using class  
- `Problem-2.py` → Generate first `a` odd numbers  
- `Problem-3.py` → Generate odd number series (adjusted for even/odd input)  
- `Problem-4.py` → Count multiples of numbers 1 to 9 in a list

## 📌 Problem Descriptions

### Problem-1: Calculator
- Inputs: `a` (float), `b` (float), and `operation` (string: add, sub, mul, div)  
- Uses a class to perform basic arithmetic operations.  

### Problem-2: Odd Number Series
- Input: Single integer `a`  
- Output: First `a` odd numbers.  

### Problem-3: Pattern Odd Number Series
- Input: Single integer `a`  
- Output: If `a` is odd → first `a` odd numbers.  
- If `a` is even → first `a-1` odd numbers.  

### Problem-4: Count Multiples
- Input: A fixed list of numbers `[1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]`  
- Output: A dictionary showing how many numbers are divisible by 1 to 9.
